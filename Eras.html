<p>Melanie has had four eras she had and era with each album but she also had an extended play which had its own era.In her Crybaby era it had many childlike themes throughout it like alice in wonderland being the theme of her song called mad hatter.In her K12 era it had many school related themes like show and tell or playgrounds even having the music video for drama club be set in an auditorium.In her After School era she had more grown up views expressed in it like what she wants from a relationship or when she made a song about forgiving people because you could die at any time and you shouldn't spend that much time over an unnecessary grudge.In her PORTALS era she has a new form as a nymph and most of the songs are about not letting bad things hold you back from evolving as a person and moving on.</p>
