<p>Melanie Martinez made three albums(Crybaby,K12,PORTALS)all about different times and experiences within someones life and even afterlife.She makes music in many genres and has music that a lot of people relate to and adore.Crybaby is about childhood trauma and events that change someone on a very deep level.K12 is about someones school experience and how little those in power actually care about the people under them.PORTALS is an album based on the same character that has been the point of view of both previous albums but instead oof it being about life its about reincarnation and the journey through the afterlife it takes to be born again thats why the album starts with a song called "DEATH" and ends with a song called "WOMB"</p>
